Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection

The goal of this part of assignment is to automatically produce color images from the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii
glass  plate  images  by  applying  some  simple  image  processing  techniques.   For  that,  we  will  need  to  extract  the
red/green/blue  color  channels  from  the  digitized  plate  images,  and  the  best  alignment  so  that  they  form  an
RGB color image with few visual artifacts.
